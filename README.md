# Shunting Yard Algorithm

## Overview
The Shunting Yard Algorithm is a versatile method for parsing mathematical expressions written in infix notation and converting them into Reverse Polish Notation (RPN). Developed by Edsger Dijkstra, this algorithm is widely used in compilers, calculators, and parsing libraries.

## Features
- Reverse Polish Notation Conversion: Converts infix expressions to RPN, facilitating easier evaluation.
- Stack-Based Parsing: Utilizes two stacks to efficiently parse expressions, optimizing performance.
- Customizable Operators: Supports customizable operators for increased flexibility.
- Tested with Plus and Multiplication Operators: Initial testing has been performed with the plus (+) and multiplication (*) operators to ensure functionality and reliability.
